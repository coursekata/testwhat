\title{Check whether the student used the correct properties (ggvis exercises)}
\usage{
test_props(
  index = 1,
  funs = "ggvis",
  props = NULL,
  allow_extra = TRUE,
  not_called_msg = NULL,
  incorrect_msg = NULL,
  error_msg = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{index}{number of ggvis caommdn to be checked}

\item{funs}{the function in which to look for the x and y data. If the same info is found in one function, the test passes.
All the functions that the teacher specifies, must be present in the students' solution! The function only looks for
properties inside the first mentioned function by the teacher.}

\item{props}{set of properties to be checked. If not specified, all properties found in the solution or checked on. If
specified as an empty charactor vector (c()), only the calling of the functions will be checked on.}

\item{allow_extra}{whether or not the definition of additional properties is accepted (default TRUE)}

\item{not_called_msg}{feedback message in case the specified function(s) was/were not found.}

\item{incorrect_msg}{feedback message in case the student specified properties do not correspond with the ones in the solution.}

\item{error_msg}{feedback maessage in case the student submitted a faulty ggvis call}
}
\description{
Check whether the student used at least as many and the correct properties as the solution inside a specific
command and inside a specific function. By default, this function will compare the ggvis functions of both
student and solution. However, the teacher can also state that the definition of data can be done in other
functions.
