  sol_code = "",
  stu_code = "",
  sol_env = NULL,

\arguments{
\item{sol_code}{Solution script as a string. If it is not specified, the
student code will be used.}

\item{stu_code}{Student submission as a string. If it is not specified, the
solution code will be used.}

\item{sol_env}{Solution environment. If this is specified, the solution code is not rerun.}

\item{stu_env}{Student environment. If this is specified, the student code is not rerun.}

\item{stu_result}{Result of calling \code{\link{evaluate}} on the student code. If this is
is specified, this overrides the output generated by running \code{stu_code}.}

\item{pec}{Pre-exercise-code as a string}

\item{ex_type}{Type of exercise as a string. Defaults to NormalExercise.}

\item{force_diagnose}{whether diagnose tests have to pass even if the checks pass (FALSE by default)}
}
\value{
The exercise state, from which you can start chaining.
}
\description{
It runs both the solution and the student submission, and populates the state
with parse data, output, etc. After running this function, the state is
available thorugh \code{\link{ex}}, from which you can start your SCT chains.
In a way, this function is a very light weight version of DataCamp's R Backend.
}
\note{
This function is only supposed to be used locally when experimenting.
  It should never be used in the eventual SCT script of an exercise.
